1. Use goroutines, create an incrementer program
    + have a variable to hold increment value 
    + launch a bunch of goroutines
        * Each goroutines should 
            - read incrementer value
                + store it in a new value
            - yield he processor with runtime.Gosched()
            - increment the new variable
            - write the value in the new variable back to incrementer variable
2. User Waitgroups to wait for all of your goroutines to finish
3. The above will create a race condition
4. Prove that it is a race condition by using the -race flag
